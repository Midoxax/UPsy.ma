/**
 * Production verification — asserts the deployed site, not the build output.
 *
 * Every other gate in this repository inspects `dist/`. None of them prove
 * anything about what a user actually receives, because the two can differ in
 * ways that matter enormously:
 *
 *   - `vercel.json` headers only exist if Vercel is reading that file. A
 *     misconfigured project, a different host, or a moved file leaves the CSP
 *     and HSTS silently absent while every local check stays green.
 *   - Deployment Protection puts an auth wall in front of the site. The owner,
 *     already logged in, sees it working. Everyone else sees a login screen.
 *     This check runs unauthenticated, so it catches that.
 *   - A build can succeed and still be served from a stale or wrong deployment.
 *
 * Runs from GitHub Actions rather than a developer machine because the runner
 * has unrestricted egress and is not logged into anything — which is exactly
 * the vantage point of a real visitor.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run check:production                  # uses package.json "homepage"
 *   PROD_URL=https://staging.example node scripts/check-production.mjs
