# Deployment

Clone to production with no undocumented steps. If something here does not
work, that is a bug in this document — fix it in the same PR.

## Runtime contract

One set of assumptions, declared once each and **checked by
`scripts/check-runtime.mjs`**, which runs first in `npm run verify` and in both
CI jobs. Documentation cannot fail a build; this can.

| | Value | Declared in | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Node | 22.x (LTS) | `.nvmrc` | local shells (`nvm use`), CI (`node-version-file`) |
| Node | 22.x (LTS) | `engines.node` | Vercel build image, npm `EBADENGINE` |
| Package manager | npm 10 | `packageManager`, `engines.npm` | corepack, Vercel |
| Install | `npm ci` | `vercel.json`, CI | production and CI |
| Build | `npm run build` | `vercel.json`, CI | production and CI |

Node is declared twice because two different consumers read two different
files, and **nothing in npm or Vercel keeps them in sync** — a half-finished
bump leaves local on one major and production on another with everything
green. The guard's first check is precisely that `.nvmrc` and `engines.node`
agree; its second is that the interpreter actually executing matches them.

CI never hardcodes a version: both jobs use `node-version-file: .nvmrc` with
`check-latest: false`, so the runner cannot drift to whatever it happens to
ship, and there is no literal to fall out of date.

### Why Node 22, and how to move off it

Node 20 reached end of life in **April 2026** — it no longer receives security
patches, which is not a runtime to hold under a platform storing clinical
records. It also broke the build for a concrete reason: jsdom depends on
undici, which calls `webidl.util.markAsUncloneable`, an API Node 20 lacks, so
the unit suite crashed on collection in CI while passing locally on 22. The
fix was to move the runtime forward, not to pin the dependency backward — an
incompatible package gets upgraded or replaced; the runtime does not get
downgraded to accommodate it.

Node 22 is the current LTS and is supported by Vercel. Verified working on it:
Vite 5, Vitest 2, jsdom 30, Playwright 1.62 (launching Chromium), axe-core
4.12, and TypeScript.

**To change the pinned version later:**

1. Update `.nvmrc` **and** `engines.node` in the same commit — the guard fails
   the build if they disagree, which is the point.
2. `nvm use && npm ci` locally, then `npm run verify`.
3. Run the browser audit, which exercises Playwright and Chromium.
4. Confirm the target is a Vercel-supported build image before merging.
5. Record the reason here, so the next person does not revert it as churn.

**npm only.** `bun.lock` and `bun.lockb` were removed: Vercel auto-detects a
bun lockfile when present, so production was installing through bun while CI
installed through npm — two different resolvers, neither written down. If you
reintroduce bun, do it everywhere at once and update this table.

`vercel.json` now sets `installCommand` and `buildCommand` explicitly rather
than relying on auto-detection, so the deploy runs the same commands CI proves
on every pull request.

## Local setup

```bash
nvm use                 # reads .nvmrc
npm ci                  # not `npm install` — ci respects the lockfile exactly
cp .env.example .env    # if you do not already have one
npm run dev             # http://localhost:8080
```

`npm run predev` regenerates `public/sitemap.xml` automatically. On a machine
without IPv6, `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1` (the default `host: "::"` fails
with `EAFNOSUPPORT` in some containers).

## Environment variables

Only `VITE_`-prefixed variables reach the client. Vite inlines them into the
bundle, so **every one of them is public** — including the Supabase anon key,
which is safe because row-level security is what actually protects the data.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | yes | Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | yes | Anon key (public by design) |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` | yes | Project identifier |
| `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` | set | Error tracking; SDK is not bundled without it |
| `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` / `VITE_POSTHOG_HOST` | no | Analytics; both required together |
| `VITE_APP_VERSION` | no | Release tag on Sentry events |

**Secrets never go in `.env`.** That file is tracked. A service-role key, Stripe
secret or Resend key committed there is in git history permanently. Put them in
Vercel's environment settings, or in `.env.local` for local work — that file is
gitignored. `npm run check:env` fails the build on any non-`VITE_` key in a
tracked `.env`, and runs first in CI.

## Verify before pushing

```bash
npm run verify
```

Runs, in order: runtime contract → committed-secret check → Supabase wiring and
schema sync → type check → unit tests → production build → bundle budget →
build verification. Same steps CI runs, so a green `verify` means a green
pipeline for everything except lint and the browser audit.

For the full browser audit:

```bash
npm run build
npx vite preview --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173 &
npm install --no-save playwright @axe-core/playwright
npm run test:audit
```

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, on every pull request. Two parallel jobs:

**Types, lint, secrets** — committed-secret check, Supabase wiring and schema
sync, `tsc --noEmit`, unit tests, ESLint, `npm audit`.

**Build and browser audit** — production build, bundle budget, build
verification, then the browser audit against a real preview server.

### Quality gates and how to tighten them

Each gate blocks at a level the codebase currently meets, and is designed to be
ratcheted. This is deliberate: a gate that is red the day it lands gets
switched off, and everything it would have caught later goes with it.

| Gate | Blocks on now | Tighten by |
|---|---|---|
| Committed secrets | any non-`VITE_` key | already strict |
| Runtime contract | drift, or wrong running major | already strict |
| Supabase sync | project mismatch, unrecorded schema drift | empty `pending-migrations.json` |
| Type check | any error | already strict |
| Unit tests | any failure | add suites for booking and payments |
| Security audit | high/critical in prod deps | `--audit-level=moderate` |
| Bundle budget | >1% or 2 KB over `bundle-budget.json` | lower the numbers |
| Build verification | missing assets, placeholders, robots/sitemap | already strict |
| Browser audit | critical findings | `AUDIT_FAIL_ON=serious` |
| Lint | nothing (~450 pre-existing problems) | drop `continue-on-error` |

**The bundle budget is the one to understand.** It is pinned to what the build
produces today, not to a target. Landing an optimisation means lowering the
number in the same PR, so the win cannot be quietly spent later. Growing the
bundle means raising it in the same PR, so the cost is visible in review.

```bash
UPDATE_BUDGET=1 node scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs   # after an intentional change
```

## Production deploy

Vercel builds from `main`. Pull requests get preview deployments using the same
`installCommand` and `buildCommand`, so a preview is a faithful rehearsal.

Already configured in `vercel.json`, no action needed:

- **Security headers** — CSP, HSTS (`preload`), `frame-ancestors 'none'`,
  `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`
- **Caching** — `/assets/*` and fonts immutable for a year (safe: filenames are
  content-hashed); `/api/*` `no-store`
- **Compression** — Vercel negotiates Brotli/gzip at the edge automatically
- **`cleanUrls`**, no trailing slash

Adding a third-party script, font or API host means adding it to the CSP in
`vercel.json`, or the browser will block it in production while it works fine
locally. `tests/unit/csp.test.ts` now asserts that every external origin
configured in `.env` appears in `connect-src`, because the failure mode is
silent: error reporting in particular breaks by going quiet, so the first
symptom of a missing CSP entry is a suspiciously clean dashboard.

## Email

Platform mail goes out through Resend from the edge functions. Sender identity
resolves in one place, `supabase/functions/_shared/sender.ts`, configured by
`MAIL_FROM_DOMAIN` and `MAIL_FROM_NAME` in the Supabase function secrets.

**Nothing delivers until the sending domain is verified in Resend.** That is
deliberate: there is no fallback to a sandbox sender, so an unverified domain
fails loudly in the logs instead of succeeding into a void.

### Verify the sending subdomain, not the root domain

Use **`notify.upsy.ma`**, which is what `SENDER_DOMAIN` in the mail functions
already anticipated. Two reasons, and the second is the one that matters
operationally:

1. **Reputation isolation.** If transactional mail gets marked as spam, it
   damages the subdomain's reputation, not the root domain that Google
   Workspace uses for real human correspondence. A psychologist's reply to a
   patient should not land in spam because a reminder cron misfired.

2. **It avoids editing the root SPF record.** A domain may have exactly one
   SPF TXT record; adding a second is a permanent error that fails *all* mail
   for that domain, Google Workspace included. Verifying a subdomain means
   adding records for a name that has none, so the root zone's existing
   `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all` is never touched. An additive change
   instead of a risky edit.

Then set `MAIL_FROM_DOMAIN=notify.upsy.ma` in the Supabase function secrets.

### DNS records required

Resend generates its own values when the domain is added — use those, not
copies from anywhere else. Expect roughly:

| Type | Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| TXT | `notify` (or as Resend specifies) | domain verification |
| TXT / CNAME | `resend._domainkey.notify` | DKIM signing |
| TXT | `send.notify` | SPF for the subdomain only |
| TXT | `_dmarc` | policy for the whole domain — see below |

Independently of Resend, the root domain is missing two records that matter:

- **DMARC.** `_dmarc.upsy.ma` does not exist, so anyone can spoof `@upsy.ma`.
  For a mental-health service that is a patient-safety issue, not only a
  deliverability one: a forged "your session is cancelled" wears the clinic's
  name. Start in observe-only mode and tighten once the reports are clean:
  `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:contact@upsy.ma`
- **DKIM for Google Workspace.** Absent, so human mail is SPF-only and fails
  whenever a message is forwarded. Enable it in the Google Admin console,
  which produces the TXT to paste.

One record in the zone is dead and can be removed: `CNAME mail.upsy.ma →
mx.upsy.ma`, whose target does not exist.

### Why this section exists

Ten of the thirteen mail functions sent from `onboarding@resend.dev` — Resend's
shared sandbox, which only delivers to the Resend account owner's own address.
Every message to a real patient or psychologist was rejected, including session
video links and appointment reminders, and nothing surfaced it: the function
returns normally and the recipient simply never hears from us. A missed session
reads as a no-show.

Authentication mail was separately branded `upsydot-frontend-kit`, a scaffold
placeholder, and session proposals as `My Personal Psychologist`. On a clinical
platform the From line is the first trust signal a patient sees, and an
unfamiliar name on a password reset is indistinguishable from phishing.

## Database and migrations

Migrations live in `supabase/migrations/`, at the repository root. That path is
not arbitrary — the CLI and every Supabase integration resolve it relative to
the root, and pointing anything at a different directory strands every
migration silently.

**A migration reaching `main` does not mean it reached the database.** There is
no build step that applies it and nothing fails when it does not: the schema
change simply is not there, and the first symptom is a runtime error against a
missing table. Two checks exist because one cannot do the job alone:

| Check | Runs | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run check:supabase` | every PR, offline | Do `config.toml`, `.env` and the URL name the same project? Do the migrations and the generated types agree? |
| `npm run check:database` | production check, needs egress | Does the table actually exist in the database? |

The offline check works by diffing the tables the migrations create against
`src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`, which is generated *from the live
database* and is therefore the only in-repo evidence of what that database
contains. It cannot distinguish "never applied" from "types are stale" — only
the online check settles that, which is why both exist.

A table the offline check cannot yet corroborate is recorded in
`supabase/pending-migrations.json` with a reason. This keeps the gate precise
rather than merely tolerant, and it closes itself: once a pending table appears
in regenerated types, the check **fails** until the entry is removed.

### Applying a migration by hand

```bash
supabase link --project-ref vuawmihxcaewzmkuarkr
supabase db push
supabase gen types typescript --project-id vuawmihxcaewzmkuarkr > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

Regenerate the types and clear the matching `pending-migrations.json` entries in
the same commit, so the repository's record of the schema moves with it.

### Where the database actually lives

**Project `vuawmihxcaewzmkuarkr` is provisioned and managed by Lovable.** It
belongs to Lovable project `355cf905-7152-433f-b59d-dda69a853e16` ("Super
UPsy.ma", workspace "MEHDI's Lovable"), which is why it does not appear in the
owner's own Supabase account and cannot be opened from the Supabase dashboard
directly. Reach it through Lovable.

`bvhqdgiptlnfclnsybaz` is a *different*, directly-owned project. It is not the
production database and nothing reads from it.

This matters beyond bookkeeping: the production database of a clinical platform
sits in an account the responsible party cannot browse. Migrating off Lovable's
managed Supabase — or at minimum obtaining direct access — is the real fix, and
is tracked as part of the Lovable coupling in ARCHITECTURE.md.

### The 2026-08 wiring fault

The Supabase GitHub integration was configured to watch `UPsy supa/supabase` —
a path that has never existed in this repository — on `bvhqdgiptlnfclnsybaz`
rather than the project the app connects to. Both halves were wrong, so no
commit-triggered migration could ever have applied, and **that is still true**:
merging a migration does not apply it.

What was *not* wrong: the schema. Every table the migrations create is present,
and no table exists in the database without a migration creating it. The
historical path — Lovable applying its own migrations to its own project — kept
them in sync. The only gap was `20260801120000_platform_events.sql`, the first
migration committed straight to GitHub, which bypassed that path.

**Resolved 2026-08-02.** The two tables were confirmed absent by querying the
database (128 tables, `profiles` present, `platform_events` missing), then
applied: two tables, nine indexes, RLS enabled on both, two admin-read policies,
and `publish_event` with EXECUTE revoked from `anon`/`authenticated` and granted
to `service_role`. Verified afterwards at 130 tables with `anon` unable to
execute the publisher. Generated types were updated to match and
`pending-migrations.json` emptied, so the gate covers all 130 tables again.

The integration itself is still misconfigured and remains a dashboard fix:
Integrations → GitHub → set the supabase directory to `supabase` and the project
to the one the app uses, or disconnect it and use the CLI as above.
`npm run check:supabase` fails on the project-mismatch half — the half that
lives in these files.

### Rollback

Vercel keeps every deployment. Promote the last good one from the dashboard —
instant, no rebuild. Because assets are content-hashed and immutable, a
rollback cannot serve a mismatched bundle.

If a bad deploy reached users, also consider the service worker: `registerType:
"autoUpdate"` means clients pick up the new build on next navigation, but a
client mid-session may hold the old one until then.

## Health checks

`.github/workflows/production-check.yml` verifies the **deployed site**, which
nothing else does: every gate in `ci.yml` inspects `dist/`, and `dist/` cannot
tell you whether Vercel is applying `vercel.json`'s headers or whether
Deployment Protection is hiding the site from everyone who is not signed in.
It runs unauthenticated, from a runner with real egress — the vantage point of
an actual visitor — after each production deploy, daily, and on demand.

It checks, in order: the site is reachable without authentication, the five
security headers are actually served, hashed assets are immutable, the routes a
pilot user needs respond, `robots.txt`/`sitemap.xml` exist, and the pending
migrations reached the database. Then it runs the accessibility audit against
production.

```bash
npm run check:production      # same check, from your machine
```

**The target URL needs no setup.** It resolves from `workflow_dispatch` input →
the `PROD_URL` repository variable → `homepage` in `package.json` → the
deployment URL. The committed `homepage` is what makes it runnable out of the
box: this job used to hard-fail when `PROD_URL` was unset, which meant the only
check that verifies the CSP and HSTS are really being served was switched off by
an empty dashboard field. Set `PROD_URL` only to override.

The production **alias** is preferred over `deployment_status.target_url` on
purpose. Per-deployment URLs (`upsy-<hash>-<team>.vercel.app`) can stay behind
SSO even when the alias is public, so checking one reports an authentication
wall no real visitor meets — a false alarm on the single signal this job exists
to give.

## Known deployment gaps

1. **No staging environment.** Preview deployments are per-PR; there is no
   long-lived pre-production environment against production-like data.
2. **No uptime or performance monitoring.** Sentry now has a DSN and captures
   errors; nothing watches availability or Core Web Vitals in the field.
3. **No automated rollback trigger.** Rollback is a human action.
4. **No synthetic check of authenticated flows.** The production check covers
   public routes only — booking and payment are unverified end to end.
5. **Migrations are not applied by the pipeline.** Nothing applies a merged
   migration; `check:database` reports the gap but cannot close it.
